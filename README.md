# ColorExplorer
PLTW 1.1.7 | Python App | "ColorExplorer" Game

This is a game made from scratch based solely off the requirement of having "exploration". This was the only guide line.


When you enter the game, You will have already descended into the endless pit and have hit the ground. Some wonder how you could reach the bottom of the endless pit if it is endless. But you rush in attempts to get back to the top. After some time you realize nothing is familar in comparison to when you were falling down and you give up. But you see on the walls "The meaning of life is at the top".

The goal of the game is to find the meaning of life. In order to find the meaning of life within the game, You must ascend to the top of the chasm. The game is procedurally generated and there is no end to the game because the platforms are randomly created. Endlessly.

This is not meant to be a functioning game by any stretch of the imagination.

It is less of an interesting and dynamic game and more so a demonstration of programming abilities and artistic capabilities using the only tools I was given: Pygame (which is a Python game library).
