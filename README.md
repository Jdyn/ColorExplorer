PLTW 1.1.7 | Python Game | 2017

The goal of the game is to find the meaning of life. In order to find the meaning, You must reach the end of the game. There is no end to the game because the platforms are procedurally generated.

This is not meant to be a fully functioning game. It is possible for procedurally generated platforms to be unreachable.

It is less of an interesting and dynamic game and more so a demonstration of programming capabilities.
This game uses the Pygame Library.
