# ColorExplorer
PLTW 1.1.7 | Python App | "ColorExplorer" Game

This is a game made from scratch for an extra credit assignment.

The goal of the game is to find the meaning of life. In order to find the meaning, You must reach the top of the chasm. The game is procedurally generated and there is no end to the game because the platforms are created endlessly.

This is not meant to be a functioning game by any stretch of the imagination.

It is less of an interesting and dynamic game and more so a demonstration of programming and artistic capabilities.
This game uses the Pygame Library.
